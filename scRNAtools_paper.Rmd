* scRNA-seq
    * What is it?
    * What is the history?
    * What is it used for?
    * How is it different to bulk?
* Analysis
    * Getting the data
    * Quality control
    * Clustering/psuedotime
    * Gene identification
    * Interpretation?

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has quickly become a tool of choice for 
interrogating the transcriptome at the resolution of individual cells. Since the
first protocols were published in 2009 the number of cells in scRNA-seq datasets
has increased exponentially, outstripping Mooreâ€™s Law [Svensson 2017]. As well 
as the size of datasets the number of studies has also increased rapidly. With 
the availability of new data has come a demand for new analysis methods. Apart 
from the scale scRNA-seq provides several challenges compared to RNA-seq 
experiments of bulk samples. More specifically scRNA-seq data is extremely 
sparse (there is no expression measured for most genes in most cells) and the 
analysis approaches required are different, as the groups of interest are 
usually not known in advance.

Since August 2016 we have collated and categorised scRNA-seq analysis software 
as it has become available. This database is now publically available at 
www.scRNA-tools.org. Here we discuss the stages of scRNA-seq analysis and their 
relationship to tools in the scRNA-tools database.

# Overview of the scRNA-tools database

* What is in the database?
* How has it been collected?

The scRNA-seq database contains information on software tools specifically
designed for the analysis of scRNA-seq data. To be eligible to be included in
the database software tools must be available for download and public use. This
can be from a software package repository (such as Bioconductor, CRAN or PyPI),
a code sharing website such as Github or directly from a private website.
Various details of the tools are recorded such as the programming language or
platform they use, details of any related publication, links to the source code
and the associated software license. Tools are also categorised according to the
tasks they are able to perform.

* Increase in tools over time

```{r plot-tools-over-time}
date.totals <- tools %>%
    select(Date = Added) %>%
    group_by(Date = as.Date(Date)) %>%
    summarise(Count = n()) %>%
    mutate(Total = cumsum(Count))

totals.plot <- ggplot(date.totals, aes(x = Date, y = Total)) +
    geom_line(size = 2, colour = pal["purple"]) +
    xlab("Date") +
    ylab("Number of tools") +
    ggtitle("Increase in tools over time") +
    theme_cowplot() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 12)
    )

ggsave("figures/tools_over_time.png", totals.plot, height = 5)
ggsave("figures/tools_over_time.pdf", totals.plot, height = 5)

## Publication status

* Publication status
* ~ half published, more as preprints
* More older tools published, reflects publishing delay

# Phases of scRNA-seq analysis

A typical scRNA-seq analysis can be divided into various phases, each of which 
consists of various tasks which can be completed using a variety of tools 
[FIGURE]. The data acquisition phase takes the raw nucleotide sequences from the
sequencing experiment and returns an matrix describing the expression of each 
gene (rows) in each cell (columns). This phase consists of tasks common to bulk 
RNA-seq experiments, such as alignment to a reference genome and quantification 
of expression, but is often extended to handle Unique Molecular Identifiers 
(UMIs). Once an expression matrix has been obtained it is vital to make sure it 
is of quality. In the data cleaning phase quality control of cells is performed 
as well as filtering of uninformative genes. Additional tasks may be performed 
to normalise the data or impute missing values and exploratory analysis is often
performed in this phase, such as viewing the datasets in reduced dimensions.

The high-quality expression matrix is the focus of the next phases of analysis. 
In Phase 3 cells are assigned, either to discrete groups via clustering or along
a continuous trajectory from one cell type to another. As high-quality reference
datasets become available it will also become feasible to classify cell directly
into different cell types. Once cells have been assigned attention turns to 
interpreting what those assignments mean. Identifying interesting genes, such as
those that are differentially expressed across group, marker genes expressed in 
a single group or genes that change expression along a trajectory, is the 
typical way to do this.

```{r analysis-phases, fig.cap = "Phases of the scRNA-seq analysis process. In Phase 1 (data acquisition) raw sequencing reads are converted into a gene by cell expression matrix. For many protocols this requires the assignment and de-duplication of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). The data is then cleaned (Phase 2) to remove low-quality cells and uninformative genes, resulting in a high-quality dataset for further analysis. Phase 3 assigns cells, either to distinct groups (clustering) or to a position on a pseudotime trajectory. Alternatively cells can be classified based on known cell types. Interesting genes (eg. differentially expressed, markers, highly variable) are then identified to explain these groups or paths (Phase 4)."}
include_graphics("figures/phases_diagram.png")
```

While there are other approaches that could be taken to analyse scRNA-seq data
these phases represent the most common path from raw sequencing reads to
biological insight.

```{r cell-assignment, fig.cap = "Strategies for assigning cells. Discrete groups of cells can be formed by clustering cells based on similar expression profiles or classifying them using reference datasets. Alternatively cells can be ordered along a trajectory from one cell type to another."}
include_graphics("figures/cell_assignment.png")
```

```{r gene-identification, fig.cap = "Examples of interesting genes to identify. When working with discrete groups tools try to find genes that are differentially expressed across the groups or marker genes that are uniquely expressed in a single group. If cells have been ordered tools instead look for genes that change expression along the trajectory, for example genes that are highly expressed and the start and lowly expressed at the end."}

## Analysis tasks

```{r categories-table}
cap = "Descriptions of categories for tools in the scRNA-tools database"

cats %>%
    mutate(Category = str_replace_all(Category, "([[:upper:]])", " \\1")) %>%
    arrange(Phase) %>%
    select(Phase, everything()) %>%
    kable(caption = cap)
```

```{r plot-categories}

cat.counts <- tools %>%

    arrange(-Count) %>%
    mutate(Prop = Count / nrow(tools)) %>%
