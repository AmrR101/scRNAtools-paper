              as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high
              variability in gene expression between individual cells.
              Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
              difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
              transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
              cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori
              knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe
              Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal
              resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq
              data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the
              differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed
              switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors,
              sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators
              that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some
              of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen.
              Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene
              expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes,
              including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic

               RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts,

              (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the
              near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the
              fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression
              studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that
              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different
              across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software
              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
              The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
              such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is

              data, gene expression has been used as feature to detect
              subpopulations, however, this data type is subject to significant
              amount of noise. Unconventionally, we propose to use filtered,
              effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs)
              information from scRNA-seq data as improved predictive features
              for subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling
              framework called SSrGE (Sparse SNV inference to reflect Gene
              Expression) to detect eeSNVs that are associated with gene
              expression profiles. In all the datasets tested, these eeSNVs
              show better accuracy than gene expression for retrieving cell
              subpopulations. Moreover, bipartite graphs of cells in
              combination with eeSNVs have better visual representation of the
              different cell subpopulations than the other methods that use
              gene expression data. We ranked genes, according to their eeSNVs
              in the cancer scRNA-seq data, and found that genes in antigen
              processing and presentation pathway have top ranked eeSNVs. They
              include HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRA in Human Leukocyte
              Antigen (HLA) complex, and B2M in histocompatibility complex MHC.
              Moreover, previously experimentally validated cancer relevant
              genes, such as KRAS and SPARC, are highly ranked for eeSNVs too.

               technology that enables high resolution detection of
               heterogeneities between cells. One important application of
               scRNA-seq data is to detect differential expression (DE) of
               genes. Currently, some researchers still use DE analysis methods
               developed for bulk RNA-Seq data on single-cell data, and some
               new methods for scRNA-seq data have also been developed. Bulk
               and single-cell RNA-seq data have different characteristics. A
               systematic evaluation of the two types of methods on scRNA-seq
               data is needed.ResultsIn this study, we conducted a series of
               experiments on scRNA-seq data to quantitatively evaluate 14
               popular DE analysis methods, including both of traditional
               methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data and new methods

               observations and recommendations for the methods under different

               scRNA-seq data with great caution with regard to different
               situations of data. Different strategies should be taken for
               data with different sample sizes and/or different strengths of

              single cell studies have restricted analysis of transcriptome
              variation to the gene level. To address these limitations, we

  author   = "McCarthy, Davis J and Chen, Yunshun and Smyth, Gordon K",
  abstract = "A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of
              read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the
              ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple
              treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking
              full account of biological variation. Biological variation
              between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical
              variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel
              empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific
              variability, even when there are relatively few biological
              replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline
              is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project.
              A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability
              of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
              expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
              expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow
              for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common
              dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance
              and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
              inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
              changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
              Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
              non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
              application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
              practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
              profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
              biological variability in complex situations. When variation is
              gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous
              compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or
              separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also
              be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications,
              including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation

              together with two popular methods originally developed for the
              analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data, but largely applied to

              experiments representing a single condition, technology, or

              challenges. In particular, traditional analytical workflows
              struggle to align subpopulations that are present across

              identify shared subpopulations between datasets as part of our R

              datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions,
              hematopoietic progenitors sequenced across two profiling
              technologies, and pancreatic cell 9atlases9 generated from human

              subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets

              R package that allows barcode demultiplexing, read alignment and
              gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing
              data generated by multiple 3 prime end sequencing protocols that
              include CEL-seq, MARS-seq and Drop-seq. scPipe produces a count
              matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an
              HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be
              used as input for downstream analyses including normalization,
              visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this
              processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible
              analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging
              suite of scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor.
              The scPipe R package is available from

              methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their

              integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
              experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
              experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
              expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
              biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
              article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
              summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on

              Applying Expedition to single pluripotent stem cells undergoing
              neuronal differentiation, we discover that up to 20\% of AS exons
              exhibit bimodality. Bimodal exons are flanked by more conserved
              intronic sequences harboring distinct cis-regulatory motifs,

              light chain sequences from single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) in B
              cells has been largely unstudied. Results: We developed a new
              software tool, BASIC, which allows investigators to use scRNA-seq
              for assembling BCR sequences at single-cell resolution. To
              demonstrate the utility of our software, we subjected nearly 200
              single human B cells to scRNA-seq, assembled the full-length

  abstract  = "1. 1 Welcome to ggplot2 ggplot2 is an R package for producing
               statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other
               graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This
               grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is
               composed of a set of independent components that can be composed
               in many di?erent ways. This makesggplot2 very powerful, because
               you are not limited to a set of pre-speci?ed graphics, but you
               can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your
               problem. This may sound overwhelming, but because there is a
               simple set of core principles and very few special cases,
               ggplot2 is also easy to learn (although it may take a little
               time to forget your preconceptions from other graphics tools).
               Practically,ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that
               take care of ?ddly details like drawing legends. The plots can
               be built up iteratively and edited later. A carefully chosen set
               of defaults means that most of the time you can produce a
               publication-quality graphic in seconds, but if you do have
               special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system
               makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time
               making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph
               that best reveals the messages in your data.",

              which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry.
              Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in

              reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets of

              transitions and spatial locations. These developments will
              eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of
              'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly
              dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However,

              differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq data. PowsimR is a
              flexible tool to simulate and evaluate differential expression
              from bulk and especially single-cell RNA-seq data making it
              suitable for a priori and posterior power analyses. Availability
              and implementation: The R package and associated tutorial are
              freely available at https://github.com/bvieth/powsimR. Contact:
